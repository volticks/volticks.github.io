# About me

Hi, i'm volticks/jamie, an aspiring security researcher from the UK.

I'm interested in PWN CTF challenges and low-level programming (although my interests change often).

Here is where you can find any writeups I make, and hopefully any security research I do in future. In addition I maintain my writeups [repository](https://github.com/volticks/CTF-Writeups) if you would rather read on github.

Currently I'm playing CTF with [Zh3r0](https://ctftime.org/team/116018) where I occupy a small part of the team.

# Contact me

You can contact me via [email](mailto:volticks@gmail.com) or over discord: volticks#4677.
