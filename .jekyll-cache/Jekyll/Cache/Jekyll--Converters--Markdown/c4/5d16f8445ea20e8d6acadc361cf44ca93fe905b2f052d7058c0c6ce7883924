<p>Hi, i’m volticks/jamie, an aspiring security researcher from the UK.</p>

<p>I’m interested in PWN CTF challenges and low-level programming (although my interests change often).</p>

<p>Here is where you can find any writeups I make, and hopefully any security research I do in future. In addition I maintain my writeups <a href="https://github.com/volticks/CTF-Writeups">repository</a> if you would rather read on github.</p>

<p>Currently I’m playing CTF with <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/116018">Zh3r0</a> where I occupy a small part of the team.</p>
